    {
      "question": "How fast can you close on my house?",
      "answer": "We can close in as little as 7 days. Most transactions close within 14-21 days, though we work on your timeline — if you need more time, we can accommodate that too."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need to make repairs before selling?",
      "answer": "No. We buy houses in any condition — including properties that need major repairs, have code violations, fire damage, mold, or structural issues. You do not need to spend a dollar on repairs."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are there any fees or commissions?",
      "answer": "Zero fees and zero commissions. Unlike selling with a real estate agent (which typically costs 5-6% in commissions), we charge nothing. The cash offer we make is the amount you receive at closing."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does selling to a cash buyer work?",
      "answer": "It is a simple 3-step process: (1) Tell us about your property by filling out our form or calling us. (2) We evaluate your home and present a fair, no-obligation cash offer within 24 hours. (3) If you accept, we handle all the paperwork and close on your timeline — as fast as 7 days."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will I get a fair price for my house?",
      "answer": "Yes. We base our offers on current market data, comparable sales in your area, and the condition of your property. While cash offers are typically 70-85% of full market value, you save on agent commissions (5-6%), repair costs, holding costs, and months of waiting — which often makes the net amount comparable to a traditional sale."
    },
    {
      "question": "What types of properties do you buy?",
      "answer": "We buy single-family homes, townhouses, condos, duplexes, multi-family properties, and vacant land. Any condition, any situation — including properties with liens, code violations, or tenants in place."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is there any obligation if I request an offer?",
      "answer": "Absolutely not. Our cash offer is 100% free and comes with zero obligation. If you decide our offer isn't right for you, there is no pressure and no cost to you."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if my house has liens or back taxes?",
      "answer": "We work with properties that have liens, back taxes, code violations, and other title issues regularly. Our team handles the resolution process so you don't have to. In many cases, these costs are simply deducted at closing."
    },
    {
      "question": "How is your offer different from a real estate agent listing?",
      "answer": "When you list with an agent, you pay 5-6% in commissions, make repairs (average $10,000-$15,000), wait 60-90+ days to close, and deal with buyer financing falling through. With us, you get a guaranteed cash offer, no repairs, no commissions, and close in as little as 7 days."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need to clean out the house before selling?",
      "answer": "No. Leave behind anything you don't want — furniture, appliances, personal items, even trash. We handle all cleanout and removal at no cost to you."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I sell my house if I'm behind on mortgage payments?",
      "answer": "Yes. Selling to a cash buyer is often the best option to avoid foreclosure. We can close quickly before the foreclosure process completes, allowing you to pay off your mortgage and potentially walk away with equity."
    },
    {
      "question": "What areas do you serve?",
      "answer": "We buy houses in the Tampa Bay area (FL), DMV region (DC, Maryland, Virginia), New York metro (Queens, Nassau County, Suffolk County), Raleigh-Durham (NC), and Atlanta metro (GA). Contact us to see if we serve your specific area."
