      question: "Is selling to a cash buyer legitimate?",
      answer:
        "Yes. Cash home buying is a legitimate and well-established industry. Reputable cash buyers like Quick Home Offer USA have verifiable reviews, transparent processes, and provide proof of funds. To protect yourself, always verify reviews, check BBB ratings, and never pay upfront fees.",
    },
    {
      question: "How much less will I get from a cash buyer vs. a realtor?",
      answer:
        "Cash offers are typically 70-85% of fair market value. However, after subtracting 5-6% agent commissions, 2-4% closing costs, repair costs, and carrying costs from a traditional sale, the net difference is often 5-15% — not the 30% many people assume.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I negotiate with a cash buyer?",
      answer:
        "Yes. Cash offers are not take-it-or-leave-it. You can negotiate the price, closing date, and other terms. Getting offers from multiple cash buyers gives you leverage.",
    },
    {
      question: "What if my realtor can't sell my house?",
      answer:
        "If your home has been on the market for 60+ days without offers, it may be overpriced, need repairs buyers aren't willing to take on, or have other issues. A cash buyer can often purchase homes that fail to sell on the traditional market.",

<li><strong>Day 1:</strong> You contact the buyer and share property details</li>

<li><strong>Day 2-3:</strong> You accept and sign the purchase agreement</li>
<li><strong>Day 3-10:</strong> Title search and closing preparation</li>
<li><strong>Day 7-14:</strong> Closing day — you get paid</li>

<h3>Realtor Timeline</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Week 1-2:</strong> Interview agents, sign listing agreement</li>
<li><strong>Week 2-4:</strong> Repairs, staging, photography, listing preparation</li>
<li><strong>Week 4-8:</strong> Active showings and open houses</li>

<li><strong>Week 8-12:</strong> Buyer inspection, appraisal, financing contingency period</li>
