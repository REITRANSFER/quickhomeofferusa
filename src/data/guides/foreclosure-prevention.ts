      question: "How many missed payments before foreclosure starts?",
      answer:
        "In most states, lenders cannot begin the foreclosure process until you are at least 120 days (roughly 4 months) behind on payments. This is required by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). However, late fees and credit damage begin after the first missed payment.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I stop foreclosure once it's started?",
      answer:
        "Yes. You can stop foreclosure at any point before the auction by paying the full amount owed (reinstatement), selling the home, negotiating a loan modification, or filing for bankruptcy (temporary halt). The earlier you act, the more options and leverage you have.",
    },
    {
      question: "Will foreclosure affect my ability to buy a home in the future?",
      answer:
        "Yes. A foreclosure stays on your credit report for 7 years. After foreclosure, you typically must wait 3-7 years before qualifying for a new mortgage (3 years for FHA, 7 years for conventional). Selling before foreclosure is far less damaging to your future home-buying ability.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is a short sale better than foreclosure?",
      answer:
        "Yes, significantly. A short sale is less damaging to your credit (typically 50-80 point drop vs. 100-160 for foreclosure), has a shorter waiting period before you can buy again (2 years vs. 3-7 years), and shows future lenders that you took responsibility for the situation.",
    },
    {
      question: "Are there free foreclosure prevention resources?",
      answer:
        "Yes. HUD-approved housing counseling agencies provide free foreclosure prevention counseling. Call 1-800-569-4287 or visit hud.gov/housing/housing_counseling to find a counselor near you. Additionally, your state's housing finance agency may have emergency assistance programs.",

      content: `<p>If you are facing foreclosure or are behind on mortgage payments, the most important thing is to <strong>act now</strong>. Every week you wait reduces your options. You have at least 6 options available to you — from keeping your home (loan modification, forbearance) to selling it (cash sale, short sale) to legal protections (bankruptcy). This guide explains each option honestly, including the pros, cons, and realistic timelines.</p>`,

    {
      heading: "Understanding the Foreclosure Timeline",
      content: `<p>Knowing where you are in the process determines which options are still available:</p>
<h3>Phase 1: Missed Payments (Month 1-3)</h3>
<p>Late fees accumulate and your lender contacts you about payment. Your credit score drops 30-100 points. <strong>All options are available.</strong></p>
<h3>Phase 2: Notice of Default / Lis Pendens (Month 4-6)</h3>
<p>Your lender files a formal notice — the legal start of foreclosure. This becomes public record. You typically have 90 days to resolve the situation. <strong>Most options are still available, but time is limited.</strong></p>
<h3>Phase 3: Notice of Sale (Month 6-9)</h3>
<p>Your home is scheduled for auction. The sale date is published publicly. <strong>Options are limited — a fast cash sale or bankruptcy can still stop the process.</strong></p>
<h3>Phase 4: Auction (Month 8-12+)</h3>
<p>Your home is sold at public auction to the highest bidder. <strong>Once the auction occurs, you lose all rights and equity in the property.</strong></p>
<p><em>Timelines vary significantly by state. Judicial foreclosure states (where the lender must go through court) can take 12-18+ months. Non-judicial states can complete foreclosure in as little as 4-6 months.</em></p>`,
    },
    {
      heading: "Option 1: Loan Modification",
      content: `<p>A loan modification permanently changes the terms of your mortgage to make payments more affordable.</p>
<h3>What Changes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Interest rate reduction</li>
<li>Term extension (e.g., 30 years to 40 years)</li>
<li>Principal forbearance (portion of balance deferred)</li>
<li>Principal reduction (rare)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Timeline: 3-6 months</h3>
<h3>Pros</h3>
<ul><li>You keep your home</li><li>Payments become affordable</li><li>Less credit damage than foreclosure</li></ul>
<h3>Cons</h3>
<ul><li>Not guaranteed — lender can deny the application</li><li>Long, paperwork-heavy process</li><li>May extend your mortgage by years</li><li>You must prove hardship and ability to pay the modified amount</li></ul>
<h3>Best For:</h3>
<p>Homeowners who want to keep their home and have stable income that can support reduced payments.</p>`,
    },
    {
      heading: "Option 2: Forbearance Agreement",
      content: `<p>Forbearance temporarily reduces or suspends your mortgage payments for a set period (typically 3-12 months).</p>
<h3>Important: Forbearance is NOT forgiveness</h3>
<p>You still owe the missed payments. After the forbearance period ends, you must repay them through a lump sum, repayment plan, or loan modification.</p>
<h3>Timeline: Immediate (can be approved in days)</h3>
<h3>Best For:</h3>
<p>Homeowners experiencing temporary hardship (job loss, medical emergency) who expect their income to recover.</p>`,

    {
      heading: "Option 3: Sell for Cash (Fastest Resolution)",
      content: `<p>Selling your home to a cash buyer like <a href="/">Quick Home Offer USA</a> is the fastest way to resolve a foreclosure situation. You sell the home, pay off the mortgage, protect your credit from foreclosure, and potentially walk away with cash.</p>
<h3>Timeline: 7-14 days</h3>
<h3>How It Works</h3>
<ol>
<li>Contact us with your property details and situation</li>
<li>We present a fair cash offer within 24 hours</li>

</ol>
<h3>Pros</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fastest option — close before the foreclosure auction</li>
<li>Protects your credit from foreclosure (far less damaging)</li>
<li>You may keep equity above the mortgage balance</li>
<li>Zero out-of-pocket costs — we pay all closing costs</li>

</ul>
<h3>Cons</h3>

<p>Homeowners who can't afford to keep the home and need to resolve the situation quickly. Especially effective when the auction date is approaching.</p>`,

    {
      heading: "Option 4: Short Sale",
      content: `<p>If you owe more than the home is worth (underwater), a short sale allows you to sell for less than the mortgage balance with the lender's approval.</p>
<h3>Timeline: 60-120 days (requires lender approval)</h3>
<h3>Pros</h3>
<ul><li>Better for credit than foreclosure</li><li>Shorter waiting period to buy again (2 years vs. 3-7)</li><li>Lender may forgive the remaining balance</li></ul>
<h3>Cons</h3>
<ul><li>Requires lender approval (not guaranteed)</li><li>Long, complex process</li><li>Forgiven debt may be taxable (consult a tax professional)</li><li>You lose the home</li></ul>
<h3>Best For:</h3>
<p>Homeowners who owe more than the home is worth and have time to navigate the lender approval process.</p>`,

    {
      heading: "Option 5: Bankruptcy (Emergency Stop)",
      content: `<p>Filing for bankruptcy triggers an automatic stay that immediately halts all foreclosure proceedings.</p>
<h3>Chapter 7 (Liquidation)</h3>
<p>Temporarily stops foreclosure but does not provide a long-term solution. The lender can request the court to lift the stay and proceed with foreclosure.</p>
<h3>Chapter 13 (Reorganization)</h3>
<p>Allows you to create a 3-5 year repayment plan to catch up on missed payments while keeping your home.</p>
<h3>Pros</h3>
<ul><li>Immediately stops the foreclosure process</li><li>Chapter 13 can help you keep your home</li></ul>
<h3>Cons</h3>
<ul><li>Stays on credit report for 7-10 years</li><li>Expensive (attorney fees $1,500-$4,000+)</li><li>Complex legal process</li><li>Chapter 7 only delays foreclosure temporarily</li></ul>
<h3>Best For:</h3>
<p>Emergency situations where the auction is imminent and you need an immediate halt, or when you have other significant debts that need restructuring.</p>`,

    {
      heading: "Option 6: Deed in Lieu of Foreclosure",
      content: `<p>You voluntarily transfer ownership of the property to the lender in exchange for being released from the mortgage obligation.</p>
<h3>Pros</h3>
<ul><li>Avoids the public foreclosure process</li><li>Slightly less damaging to credit than foreclosure</li><li>May negotiate relocation assistance from lender</li></ul>
<h3>Cons</h3>
<ul><li>You lose the home and all equity</li><li>Lender must agree (not guaranteed)</li><li>May result in taxable forgiven debt</li></ul>
<h3>Best For:</h3>
<p>Homeowners with little or no equity who want to avoid the stigma and process of public foreclosure.</p>`,

<li><strong>Don't ignore the situation.</strong> Foreclosure doesn't go away — it gets worse with time.</li>

<li><strong>Know your timeline.</strong> Find out exactly where you are in the process and how much time you have.</li>
