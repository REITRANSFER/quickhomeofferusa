      question: "Do I have to go through probate to sell an inherited house?",
      answer:
        "In most cases, yes — unless the property was held in a living trust, had a transfer-on-death deed, or was jointly owned with right of survivorship. Probate is the legal process that transfers ownership from the deceased to the heirs. The timeline varies by state but typically takes 6-12 months.",
    },
    {
      question: "How much tax do I pay when selling an inherited house?",
      answer:
        "Inherited properties receive a 'stepped-up basis,' meaning the tax basis is the fair market value at the time of inheritance — not the original purchase price. If you sell shortly after inheriting at a similar price, you may owe little or no capital gains tax. Consult a tax professional for your specific situation.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I sell an inherited house that needs major repairs?",
      answer:
        "Yes. Cash home buyers like Quick Home Offer USA specialize in buying inherited properties in any condition. You don't need to make repairs, clean out the property, or make any improvements. We buy as-is.",
    },
    {
      question: "What if there are multiple heirs who disagree about selling?",
      answer:
        "If heirs can't agree, a partition action (lawsuit) can force the sale. This is costly and time-consuming. A better approach is mediation or agreeing to sell and split the proceeds. If one heir wants to keep the property, they can buy out the others' shares.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I sell an inherited house with a mortgage on it?",
      answer:
        "Yes. The mortgage doesn't disappear when the owner passes away. However, it is paid off from the sale proceeds at closing. If the mortgage balance exceeds the home's value, a short sale may be necessary.",

      heading: "Step 1: Understand the Probate Process",
      content: `<p>Before you can sell an inherited property, ownership must be legally transferred to you. In most cases, this requires probate.</p>
<h3>What Is Probate?</h3>
<p>Probate is a court-supervised process that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Validates the deceased person's will (or determines heirs if there's no will)</li>
<li>Appoints an executor (also called personal representative)</li>
<li>Inventories and appraises estate assets</li>
<li>Pays outstanding debts and taxes</li>
<li>Distributes remaining assets to heirs</li>
</ul>
<h3>Probate Timeline by State</h3>
<p>Probate typically takes 6-12 months but can take longer for complex estates. Some states have simplified probate for smaller estates (often under $50K-$100K in value). Check your state's specific rules.</p>
<h3>When Probate Isn't Required</h3>
<ul>
<li>Property was held in a <strong>living trust</strong></li>
<li>Property had a <strong>transfer-on-death deed</strong> (available in 29 states)</li>
<li>Property was <strong>jointly owned with right of survivorship</strong></li>
<li>Estate qualifies for <strong>simplified/small estate probate</strong></li>
</ul>

    },
    {
      heading: "Step 2: Secure and Maintain the Property",
      content: `<p>While probate is pending, the executor is responsible for maintaining the property. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Change the locks</strong> if security is a concern</li>
<li><strong>Notify the insurance company</strong> — vacant properties need different coverage</li>
<li><strong>Continue paying property taxes</strong> (from estate funds if possible)</li>
<li><strong>Maintain utilities</strong> to prevent pipe freezing, mold, and deterioration</li>
<li><strong>Basic lawn care and maintenance</strong> to avoid code violations</li>
<li><strong>Secure valuables</strong> and create an inventory of personal property</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> These costs add up quickly. A vacant inherited property can easily cost $500-$2,000+ per month in carrying costs. This is one reason many heirs choose to sell quickly. See our <a href="/situations/vacant-property">vacant property page</a> for more on these costs.</p>`,

      heading: "Step 3: Understand the Tax Implications",
      content: `<h3>Stepped-Up Basis: The Big Tax Advantage</h3>
<p>When you inherit a property, the IRS gives you a "stepped-up basis." This means your cost basis for tax purposes is the fair market value (FMV) at the date of death — not what the deceased originally paid.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Original purchase price (1990): $80,000</li>
<li>Fair market value at date of death: $350,000</li>
<li>Your stepped-up basis: $350,000</li>
<li>If you sell for $350,000, your capital gain is $0</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a massive tax benefit. If the deceased had sold the home themselves, they would have owed capital gains tax on $270,000.</p>
<h3>Capital Gains Tax If You Wait</h3>
<p>If you hold the property and it appreciates, you'll owe capital gains tax on the difference between your stepped-up basis and the eventual sale price. Long-term capital gains rates (held over 1 year) are 0%, 15%, or 20% depending on your income.</p>
<h3>Estate Tax</h3>
<p>The federal estate tax exemption is $13.99 million per individual in 2026. Unless the total estate exceeds this threshold, no federal estate tax applies. Some states have lower thresholds.</p>
<h3>Property Tax Reassessment</h3>
<p>In some states (notably California under Proposition 19), inheriting a property can trigger a property tax reassessment, potentially increasing annual taxes significantly. Check your state's rules.</p>`,

      heading: "Step 4: Decide What to Do With the Property",
      content: `<p>You have three main options:</p>
<h3>Option A: Move Into It</h3>
<p>If the property is in a location and condition that works for you, moving in can make financial sense — especially if the mortgage is paid off. Consider property taxes, insurance, maintenance costs, and any renovation needs.</p>
<h3>Option B: Rent It Out</h3>
<p>If the property is in a good rental market and decent condition, renting can provide ongoing income. However, being a landlord requires time, money, and management (or paying a property manager 8-10% of rent). You also become responsible for all repairs and maintenance.</p>
<h3>Option C: Sell It</h3>
<p>Selling is the most common choice for inherited property, especially when:</p>
<ul>
<li>You don't live nearby and can't manage the property</li>
<li>The property needs significant repairs</li>
<li>Multiple heirs need to split the proceeds</li>
<li>You don't want the ongoing costs and responsibilities</li>
<li>You need the cash for other purposes</li>
</ul>`,

      heading: "Step 5: Choose How to Sell",
      content: `<h3>Option 1: Sell to a Cash Buyer (Fastest)</h3>
<p>Cash buyers like <a href="/">Quick Home Offer USA</a> specialize in inherited properties. We buy as-is, handle cleanout, coordinate with probate attorneys, and can close in 7-14 days after probate approval.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Timeline:</strong> 7-14 days after authorization to sell</li>
<li><strong>Cost to you:</strong> $0 (we pay all closing costs)</li>
<li><strong>Repairs needed:</strong> None</li>
<li><strong>Cleanout needed:</strong> None (we handle it)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Option 2: List With a Real Estate Agent</h3>
<p>If the home is in good condition and you have time, listing with an agent can get the highest price.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Timeline:</strong> 60-120 days</li>
<li><strong>Cost to you:</strong> 5-6% commission + 2-4% closing costs + repairs + staging</li>
<li><strong>You'll need to:</strong> Clean out, repair, stage, and manage showings</li>
</ul>

      heading: "Step 6: Handle the Personal Property",
      content: `<p>Inherited homes often come filled with decades of belongings. Here's a systematic approach:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Inventory valuable items</strong> — jewelry, art, antiques, collectibles, important documents</li>
<li><strong>Distribute items per the will</strong> or agreement among heirs</li>
<li><strong>Donate usable items</strong> — many charities will pick up furniture and household goods</li>
<li><strong>Hire a junk removal service</strong> for the rest ($300-$1,500 depending on volume)</li>
<li><strong>Or sell to a cash buyer</strong> — many (including us) will purchase the home with everything inside and handle cleanout</li>
</ol>`,
    },
    {
      heading: "Common Mistakes to Avoid",
      content: `<ul>
<li><strong>Waiting too long to sell:</strong> Every month the property sits costs money. Taxes, insurance, and maintenance don't stop because the owner passed away.</li>
<li><strong>Not getting a professional appraisal:</strong> You need the FMV at the date of death for the stepped-up basis. Get a formal appraisal even if you plan to sell quickly.</li>
<li><strong>Skipping probate when required:</strong> Selling without proper legal authority can result in the sale being voided. Work with a probate attorney.</li>
<li><strong>Spending too much on repairs:</strong> If you're selling, don't invest heavily in repairs. Cash buyers buy as-is, and over-renovating an inherited home rarely yields a good return.</li>
<li><strong>Ignoring the emotional side:</strong> Selling a loved one's home is emotional. Take the time you need, but don't let emotions lead to indefinitely carrying a property you can't afford.</li>
